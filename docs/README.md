# The Upgrow Website

This is the source code for the Upgrow website. It contains the Upgrow Guide as
well as the API documentation for the Upgrow Ruby gem.

The website is built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev), styled with
[Bulma](https://bulma.io), templated with
[Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/), and hosted on GitHub pages.

## Local Development

After cloning Upgrow, change to the `docs` directory, which holds the source
code for the website as a Node package.

```shell
$ cd docs
```

Make sure you have the required dependencies using NPM:

```shell
$ npm install
```

Now you can use the `serve` script to run SASS, ESLint, build the pages as well
as start the local HTTP server, all at once:

```shell
$ npm run serve
```

Any changes on the templates will trigger an automatic rebuild if the server is
running. There is no need to restart the server.

## Building the API documentation

The Upgrow Ruby code is documented using [YARD](https://yardoc.org). Eleventy is
able to serve the HTML contents generated by YARD but you must build those pages
manually first.

After cloning Upgrow, install the required Ruby dependencies from the root of
the Git local repository:

```shell
$ bundle install
```

Then you can invoke the YARD command to generate the documentation:

```shell
$ bundle exec yard doc
```

YARD is pre-configured to output the documentation pages at `docs/api`. You can
then `cd` to `docs` and start the HTTP server from that location by following
the steps above.
